# My Learning Journey

Hi, I'm John, welcome to my Git blog where I have decided to document some of my project experiences and experiments with Product Management, AI machine learning and not to be overlooked, various productivity systems and platforms.

As a Product Manager based in Florida. With over 20 years of experience in the technology sector and more than 4 years of hands-on product management expertise, I have a proven track record of leading successful teams and delivering impactful digital initiatives.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of managing several major projects, including the IDEMIA Experience Developer Portal, where I helped create market-leading identity and security solutions, and DASI’s B2B Aerospace E-commerce Portal, streamlining procurement processes for the aviation industry. These experiences have honed my ability to transform complex ideas into innovative, customer-centric solutions that drive business success.

As a product manager, I bridge the gap between market needs and organizational capabilities. From ideation to product launch and beyond, I ensure products deliver exceptional value to customers while achieving strategic business goals. Whether it’s leading agile project sprints, fostering collaboration across teams, or stepping into roles that require coding, research, or design, I adapt to the demands of any challenge.

My approach is grounded in curiosity and collaboration—asking the right questions, identifying opportunities, and assembling the right team to deliver meaningful results.

## When It All Began

In my early teens, my grandmother worked for Texas Instruments and gifted me a 16K TRS Color Computer that seemingly small act of loving kindness changed everything in my life. As I began learning BASIC programming, I could see what felt like endless potential unfolding before me.

While learning about variables, I discovered I could pass text into them and recall that text at any point. It all hit me in a eureka moment - if I did this correctly, I could ask a program a question and it would respond. For what felt like 24 hours straight, I typed away at that chiclet-style keyboard, trying to anticipate every question that might be asked (as much as a 13-year-old boy could imagine).

That primitive chatbot was my first glimpse into what we now call AI. Years later, I'm still fascinated by the same fundamental question: how do we create meaningful communication between humans and machines?

This blog documents some of my journey exploring that question with modern tools, realistic hardware constraints, and decades of real-world IT experience.
