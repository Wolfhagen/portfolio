# My AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my blog where I document my projects and experiments with AI and machine learning. Not to be overlooked, I will also be documenting my experiences with various productivity systems and platforms.

## What Iâ€™m Currently Working On.

- Productivity System Projects
    - Micrsoft 365
      - Maestro 

- AI Projects
  - Local LLM setups with Ollama
  - Agentic workflows with N8N
  - RAG implementations
  - AI on resource-constrained hardware

## When It All Began

In my early teens, my grandmother worked for Texas Instruments and gifted me a 16K TRS Color Computer that seemingly small act of loving kindness changed everything in my life. As I began learning BASIC programming, I could see what felt like endless potential unfolding before me.

While learning about variables, I discovered I could pass text into them and recall that text at any point. It all hit me in a eureka moment - if I did this correctly, I could ask a program a question and it would respond. For what felt like 24 hours straight, I typed away at that chiclet-style keyboard, trying to anticipate every question that might be asked (as much as a 13-year-old boy could imagine).

That primitive chatbot was my first glimpse into what we now call AI. Years later, I'm still fascinated by the same fundamental question: how do we create meaningful communication between humans and machines?

This blog documents my journey exploring that question with modern tools, realistic hardware constraints, and decades of real-world IT experience.
